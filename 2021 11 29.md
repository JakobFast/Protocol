##**our first day of the bootcamp** 

_We introduced ourselves and also learned about the way that lays infront of us in the bootcamp
_
We got introduced to all the topics that awaiten us and we were evenly excited throughout the participants. 
  The bootcamp consists of 9 Modules over 3 months (from 29.11.2021 to 25.02.2022) 
  which include methods and tools like python, SQL, Data Sourcing, tableau, gile workflow etc. 

We are meant to help each other (of course!!!) to learn and improve our skills. If someone is on the edge to the ~~dark deepth of despair~~, 
> it is the courses responsibility to hold onto that person(s) and help. :)


After that we got our setup installed and prepared so we are ready for our upciming challenges. 
The first one was not far. We got introduced to github and learned how to create repositories and branches. 
It is important to create different branches within one repository because if you make a mistake working in the main branch, you will mess up the live working system.
